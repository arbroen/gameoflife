### Introduction

Came across this simple algorithm. 
Built my own ungoogled version for the sake of displaying some skills. 

Have fun. 

### Installation
Start by cloning it. I won't pollute pip for this. 
The next step is creating a virtualenv. 

After you've cd'ed into the root directory you can run the following 
to install it locally. 

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

After this you can run everything as required. If you want to go development 
mode feel free to try:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/development.txt
``` 

Basically only installs tox but we developers like a clear division of purpose.

### Testing
The suite comes fully tested.
